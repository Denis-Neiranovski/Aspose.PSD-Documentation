Aspose.PSD provides functionality to convert AI files to PDF files. For Ai export you need to use the following code snippet:

Below provided sample code demonstrates how to export the AI file to PDF with the [File Format Manipulation API](/psd/net/manipulate-different-image-file-formats/)

You can specify additional PDF parameters in [PdfOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.imageoptions/pdfoptions), like Author, Keywords, Subject, Title.

Mass server processing of AI files to PDF can be useful for business automation. PDF format can not be edited as a PSD file. PDF Format can not be changed, so you can use it as an unchangeable format to work with your customers or partners.
