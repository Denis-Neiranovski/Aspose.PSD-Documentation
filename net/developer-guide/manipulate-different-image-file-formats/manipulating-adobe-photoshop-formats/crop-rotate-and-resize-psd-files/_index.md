## **Resizing PSD File**
This article demonstrates the usage of Aspose.PSD for .NET to perform Resize operation on PSD files. Aspose.PSD APIs have exposed efficient and easy to use methods to achieve this goal. Aspose.PSD for .NET has exposed the [Resize](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd/image/methods/resize/index) method for the Image class that can be used to re-size existing images on the fly.

The steps to perform Resize are as simple as below:

1. Load in image using the factory method Load exposed by Image class.
1. Call the [Image.Resize](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd/image/methods/resize) method while specifying new Height and Width.
1. Save the results.
